# Readme Generator - creates the readme file for github.
## Description
This project contains three seperate files (index.questions and generate-markdown.js), where I am using node js and other javascript libraries-inquirer and axios to get API from github and display the information on the page.Question file contains the questions and markdown is basicly displays the style and format of the text and image.
## Installation
When I created this file the first thing I did was npm init-y, install inquirer axios, which created package json file.
## Usage
Once we create the file, installed all dependencies and wrote the code for it we have to run the node application in gitbash.After typing node index.js the questions will appear wich first will ask about username and email ,follow by a github image which we got from avatar url.Then we have to say few words an=bout the project itself and after its all done the answers will be automatically generated into readme file.
